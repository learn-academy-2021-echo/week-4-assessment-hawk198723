# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are a snapshot of state that are passed on to components tasked with displaying and/or letting a user interact with that information.

  Researched answer: Props (properties) is a keyword in React for passing information from one component to another
                     Props are only passed in one direction, from parent to child
                     Props cannot be updated, they are "read only"

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: it's a very abstrct programming language. You can use it to build an encapsulate abstrct object. Whenever we need it, use can just call that object's name(instance).  Functional programming , such C language. we cann't do it like OOP language, the data has to run from top to buttom. Not that flexible like OOP language.

  Researched answer: In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects. In Object-oriented programming, it is really hard to maintain objects while increasing the levels of inheritance.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Integer is a number without a decimal point. Float is a number with a decimal point.

  Researched answer:Integer operators and arithmetic in Ruby are very similar to what you've seen so far in JavaScript. If you want to return a non-whole number(float) in Ruby you must pass a float into the equation.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Ruby always returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: There are four different types of variables in Ruby- Local variables, Instance variables, Class variables and Global variables. An instance variable in ruby has a name starting with @ symbol, and its content is restricted to whatever the object itself refers to. Two separate objects, even though they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

4. ORM:Object Relational Mapper.
It means you don't have to manually call the database yourself; the ORM handles it for you. Ruby on Rails uses one called ActiveRecord, and it's a really good one. Active Record gives us several mechanisms, the most important being the ability to: > Represent models and their data. 

5. Active Record: Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database. It is an implementation of the Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an Object Relational Mapping system.
